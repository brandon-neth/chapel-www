Sort
====
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use Sort;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import Sort;



This module supports standard algorithms for sorting data.
It is designed to
be flexible and efficient, allowing the user to define custom comparators to
sort any data type, as long as the comparator implements the appropriate
sorting interface.

The simplest way to sort an array is to call the :proc:`sort` function on the
array. The sort function will use the default comparator to sort the array in
ascending order.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/basicSort.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

The sort function can also accept a region argument to sort a subset of an
array. This is offered as an optimization over using an array slice which may
have performance overhead.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/regionSort.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

The sort function can also be called on a list, be stable or unstable, and
accept a custom comparator.
See the :proc:`sort(x: list)<Sort.sort>` function for details.

.. _comparators:

Comparators
-----------

Comparators allow sorting data by a mechanism other than the
default comparison operations between array elements.

The :proc:`sort` function can accept a comparator argument, which defines how
the data is sorted. If no comparator is passed, the default comparator is
used.

Reverse sorting is handled by the :record:`reverseComparator`.
See :ref:`Reverse Comparator<reverse-comparator>` for details.


To use a custom comparator, define a record or a class which implements the
appropriate sorting interface.

Comparators need to implement one, and only one, of the following interfaces
as well as at least one of their associated methods:

  * :interface:`keyComparator` -- see `The keyComparator interface`_
  * :interface:`relativeComparator` -- see `The relativeComparator interface`_
  * :interface:`keyPartComparator` -- see `The keyPartComparator interface`_

See the section below for discussion of each of these interfaces and methods.

*Future:*

  Provide a unified ``sortComparator`` interface, which can represent an
  exclusive or (XOR) of the three interfaces above.


The keyComparator interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``keyComparator`` interface is used to sort data by a key value. Records
implementing this interface must define a ``key`` method.

Today, it is an error for a comparator implementing the ``keyComparator``
interface to contain a ``key`` method as well as one of the other methods
that are part of the ``relativeComparator`` or ``keyPartComparator``
interfaces. This restriction might be lifted in future releases.

The .key method
***************

The ``key(elt)`` method accepts 1 argument, which will be an element from the
array being sorted.

The default key method would look like this:

.. code-block:: chapel

  proc defaultComparator.key(elt) {
    return elt;
  }


As an example, if the user wants to sort an array by the absolute values of its
elements, the user can define a comparator with a key method as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/keyComparator.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

The return type of ``key(elt)`` must support the ``<``
operator, which is used by the base compare method of all sort routines. If the
``<`` operator is not defined for the return type, the user may define it
themselves like so:

.. code-block:: chapel

  operator <(x: returnType, y: returnType): bool {
    ...
  }


The relativeComparator interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``relativeComparator`` interface is used to sort data by comparing two
elements directly. Records implementing this interface must define a
``compare`` method.

The .compare method
*******************

The ``compare(x, y)`` method accepts 2 arguments, which will be 2 elements from
the array being sorted. The return value should be a numeric signed type
indicating how x and y compare to each other. The conditions between ``x`` and
``y`` should result in the following return values for ``compare(x, y)``:

  ============ ==========
  Return Value Condition
  ============ ==========
  ``> 0``      ``x > y``
  ``0``        ``x == y``
  ``< 0``      ``x < y``
  ============ ==========

The default compare method for a signed integral type can look like this:

.. code-block:: chapel

    proc defaultComparator.compare(x, y) {
      if x < y then return -1;
      else if x > y then return 1;
      else return 0;
    }


The absolute value comparison example from above can alternatively be
implemented with a ``relativeComparator`` as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/compareComparator.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

The keyPartComparator interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keyPartComparator interface defines how a comparator should sort parts of
a key using the ``keyPart`` method. This is used for certain sort algorithms.
Records implementing this interface must define a ``keyPart`` method.

A comparator implementing this interface can optionally also provide a
`compare` method. In that event, the sort algorithm will use whichever is
appropriate for the algorithm and expect that they have consistent results.

The .keyPart method
*******************

A ``keyPart(elt, i)`` method returns *parts* of key value at a time. This
interface supports radix sorting for variable length data types, such as
strings. It accepts two arguments:

 * ``elt`` is the element being sorted
 * ``i`` is the part number of the key requested, starting from 0

A ``keyPart`` method should return a tuple consisting of *section* and a *part*.

 * The *section* must be of type :type:`keyPartStatus`. It indicates when the
   end of ``elt`` has been reached and in that event how it should be sorted
   relative to other array elements.

 * The *part* can be any signed or unsigned integral type and can contain any
   value. The *part* will be ignored unless the *section* returned is
   :enumconstant:`keyPartStatus.returned`.


Let's consider several example ``keyPart`` methods. All of these are
simplifications of ``keyPart`` methods already available in the
:type:`defaultComparator`.

This ``keyPart`` method supports sorting tuples of 2 integers:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/keyPartComparator.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE_TUPLE_INT
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE_TUPLE_INT

Here is a ``keyPart`` to support sorting of strings:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/keyPartComparator.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE_STRING
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE_STRING

.. _reverse-comparator:

Reverse Comparator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sort functions in Chapel do not have a ``reverse`` argument. Instead, reverse
sorting is handled through the comparator interface.

An instance of the type :record:`reverseComparator` can be passed to a sort
function to reverse the default sorting order.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/reversedSort.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

To reverse the sort order of a user-defined comparator, pass the user-defined
comparator to the initializer of the module-defined
:record:`reverseComparator` record, which can be passed to the sort function.

For this example, we will reverse the absolute value comparison from above
using the ``relativeComparator`` interface, although the same can be done with
the ``keyComparator`` interface.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Sort/doc-examples/reversedCustomSort.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

.. function:: proc sort(ref x: [], comparator: ? = new defaultComparator(), param stable: bool = false)

   
   
   Sort the elements in the 1D rectangular array ``x``.
   After the call, ``x`` will store elements in sorted order.
   
   The choice of sorting algorithm used is made by the implementation.
   
   At present, non-distributed arrays and Block-distributed arrays can be sorted.
   
   .. note::
   
     When reordering elements, the sort implementation might use assignment, memory
     moves, or the swap operator. Additionally, the sort might
     copy-initialize some elements, for example, to create a pivot in quicksort.
   
   .. note::
   
     This function chooses among the following algorithms based on the arguments:
   
      * a local, parallel radix sort
      * a parallel improved quick sort
      * TimSort
      * a distributed, parallel radix sort
      * a distributed, parallel sample sort
   
     The algorithms used will change over time. Currently, the choice process is:
   
      * use the local radix sort for ``stable=false`` sorting a non-distributed
        array where radix sorting is possible (see below)
      * use the improved quick sort for ``stable=false`` sorting of a
        non-distributed array when radix sorting is not possible
      * use TimSort for ``stable=true`` sorting of a non-distributed array
      * use a distributed, parallel radix sort when sorting a distributed array
        where radix sorting is possible (for both ``stable=true`` and
        ``stable=false``)
      * use a distributed, parallel sample sort when sorting a distributed array
        and radix sorting is not possible (for both ``stable=true`` and
        ``stable=false``).
   
     Radix sorting is possible if the following conditions are met:
   
       * the array being sorted is over a non-strided domain
       * ``comparator`` includes a ``keyPart`` method for ``eltType``
         or includes a ``key`` returning a value for which the default comparator
         includes a ``keyPart`` method
   
     Note that the default comparator includes ``keyPart`` methods for:
   
       * ``int``
       * tuples of ``int``
       * ``uint``
       * tuples of ``uint``
       * ``real``
       * tuples of ``real``
       * ``imag``
       * tuples of ``imag``
       * ``string``
       * ``c_string``
   
   :arg x: The array to be sorted
   :type x: `array`
   :arg comparator: :ref:`Comparator <comparators>` record that defines how the
     data is sorted.
   :arg stable: Defaults to ``false``. If it is ``false``, the implementation
     can sort in a way that reorders equal keys. If it is ``true``, it will use a
     stable algorithm in order to preserve the order of equal keys.
    

.. function:: proc sort(ref x: list(?), comparator: ? = new defaultComparator(), param stable: bool = false)

   
   
   Sort the elements in the list ``x``. After the call, ``x`` will store elements
   in sorted order.
   
   See :proc:`sort` declared above for details.
   
   .. warning::
   
     Sorting the elements of a list may invalidate existing references
     to the elements contained in the list.
   
   :arg x: The list to be sorted
   :type x: :type:`~List.list`
   :arg comparator: :ref:`Comparator <comparators>` record that defines how the
     data is sorted.
   :arg stable: Defaults to ``false``. If it is ``false``, the implementation
     can sort in a way that reorders equal keys. If it is ``true``, it will use a
     stable algorithm in order to preserve the order of equal keys.
    

.. function:: proc sort(ref x: [], comparator, region: range(?), param stable: bool = false)

   
   
   Sort the elements in the range 'region' within in the 1D rectangular array
   ``x``.  After the call, ``x[region]`` will store elements in sorted order.
   This function accepts a 'region' range as an optimized alternative to using an
   array view.
   
   See the :proc:`sort` declared just above for details.
   
   .. note::
   
     Due to uncertainty about the usefulness of this routine, it is unstable.
     Please comment on https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/25648 if
     you find this routine important in your work.
   
    

.. function:: proc sort(ref Data: [?Dom] ?eltType, comparator: ?rec = new defaultComparator(), param stable: bool = false, param inPlaceAlgorithm: bool = false)

   .. warning::

      The 'sort' function with 'Data' and 'inPlaceAlgorithm' arguments has been deprecated, please use the 'sort' function with an 'x' argument instead

   
   
   Sort the elements in the 1D rectangular array ``Data``.
   After the call, ``Data`` will store elements in sorted order.
   
   The choice of sorting algorithm used is made by the implementation.
   
   .. note::
   
     When reordering elements, the sort implementation might use assignment, memory
     moves, or the swap operator. Additionally, the sort might
     copy-initialize some elements, for example, to create a pivot in quicksort.
   
   .. note::
   
     This function currently either uses a parallel radix sort or a parallel
     improved quick sort.  For stable sort, use :proc:`sort` with ``stable=true``.
     The algorithms used will change over time.
   
     It currently uses parallel radix sort if the following conditions are met:
   
       * the array being sorted is over a non-strided domain
       * ``comparator`` includes a ``keyPart`` method for ``eltType``
         or includes a ``key`` returning a value for which the default comparator
         includes a ``keyPart`` method
   
     Note that the default comparator includes ``keyPart`` methods for:
   
       * ``int``
       * tuples of ``int``
       * ``uint``
       * tuples of ``uint``
       * ``real``
       * tuples of ``real``
       * ``imag``
       * tuples of ``imag``
       * ``string``
       * ``c_string``
   
   :arg Data: The array to be sorted
   :type Data: [] `eltType`
   :arg comparator: :ref:`Comparator <comparators>` record that defines how the
     data is sorted.
   :arg stable: Defaults to ``false``. If it is ``false``, the implementation
     can sort in a way that reorders equal keys. If it is ``true``, it will use a
     stable algorithm in order to preserve the order of equal keys.
   :arg inPlaceAlgorithm: Defaults to ``false``. If it is ``false``, the
     implementation can make a copy of ``Data`` for scratch storage during the
     sort. If it is ``true``, it will use an in-place algorithm in order to use
     less memory.

   :returns: a *key* element to sort by
   :rtype: a type that support '<'
   

.. enum:: enum keyPartStatus { pre = -1, returned = 0, post = 1 }

   
   Indicates when the end of an element has been reached and in that event how
   it should be sorted relative to other array elements.

   .. enumconstant:: enum constant pre = -1

      No more key parts for element, sort it before those with more parts 

   .. enumconstant:: enum constant returned = 0

      A key part for element is being returned

.. interface:: interface keyPartComparator

   .. warning::

      keyPartComparator is not yet stable

   
   The keyPartComparator interface defines how a comparator should sort parts of
   a key, by defining :proc:`~keyPartComparator.Self.keyPart`. This is used for
   certain sort algorithms. If :proc:`~keyPartComparator.Self.keyPart` is not
   appropriate, the sort implementation may use
   :proc:`~keyPartComparator.Self.compare` instead.

   .. method:: proc Self.keyPart(elt, i: int): (keyPartStatus, integral)

   
   A ``keyPart(elt, i)`` method returns *parts* of key value at a time. This
   interface supports radix sorting for variable length data types, such as
   strings. It accepts two arguments:
   
   * ``elt`` is the element being sorted
   * ``i`` is the part number of the key requested, starting from 0
   
   A ``keyPart`` method should return a tuple consisting of *section* and a *part*.
   
   * The *section* must be of type :type:`keyPartStatus`. It indicates when the
     end of ``elt`` has been reached and in that event how it should be sorted
     relative to other array elements.
   
   * The *part* can be any signed or unsigned integral type and can contain any
     value. The *part* will be ignored unless the *section* returned is
     :enumconstant:`keyPartStatus.returned`.
   
   :arg elt: the element being sorted
   :arg i: the part number requested
   :returns: ``(section, part)`` where ``section`` is a :type:`keyPartStatus`
             and ``part`` is an integral type.
   

   .. method:: proc Self.compare(x, y: x.type)

   not required to be implemented by comparators that implement the
   :interface:`keyPartComparator` interface.
   
   :arg x: the first element to compare
   :arg y: the second element to compare
   :returns: -1 if ``x`` should be sorted before ``y``,
              1 if ``x`` should be sorted after ``y``,
              and 0 if ``x`` and ``y`` are equal
   :rtype: a signed integral
   

.. interface:: interface relativeComparator

      See also `The .compare method`_.
      
      :returns: 1 if ``y < x``
      :returns: 0 if ``x == y``
