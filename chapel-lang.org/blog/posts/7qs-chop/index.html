<p>This installment of our <a href="../../series/7-questions-for-chapel-users/">7 Questions for Chapel Users</a> series represents our first tag-team
interview, in which we talk with not one but two Chapel users.  Tiago
Carneiro and Guillaume Helbecque are the principal developers of
ChOp—the Chapel-based Optimization Project—which focuses on solving
combinatorial branch-and-bound computations.  Read on to learn more
about their work and experiences with Chapel!</p>
<h4 id="1-who-are-you">
<a href="#1-who-are-you">1. Who are you?</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Tiago:</strong> My name is Tiago Carneiro, and I specialize in
High-Performance Computing (HPC), having gained experience at research
institutions such as INRIA, Huawei, and Imec.  In late 2018, I
initiated a research project with Professor Nouredine Melab at
INRIA-Lille, France, which eventually grew into the Chapel-based
Optimization Project (<a href="https://github.com/tcarneirop/ChOp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChOp</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> My name is Guillaume Helbecque, and I am currently a
postdoctoral researcher in France, working within the INRIA BONUS
research team (Big Optimization aNd Ultra-Scale Computing). I hold an
academic background in applied mathematics and high-performance
computing, and I recently completed my Ph.D. at the University of
Lille, under the partial supervision of Professor Nouredine Melab.</p>

<a href="#2-what-do-you-do-what-problems-are-you-trying-to-solve">2. What do you do? What problems are you trying to solve?</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Tiago:</strong> Since the late 2000s, I’ve been dedicated to researching
parallel computing for solving combinatorial optimization
problems. Initially, my work focused on peer-to-peer networks,
primarily utilizing Java and the JXTA protocol.</p>
<p>Later, during my undergraduate years, as CUDA-capable GPUs became more
accessible in Brazil, I shifted my research. I began exploring the
application of GPUs to exact optimization methods like Backtracking
and Branch-and-Bound, adapting traditional optimization algorithms for
these new architectures.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>More recently, my research addressed the challenge of finding a
trade-off between performance and productivity in distributed
heterogeneous combinatorial search. This also involved tackling
critical issues of heterogeneity, portability, and scalability within
such systems—the very foundation of the Chapel-based Optimization
Project (ChOp) that I mentioned.</p>
<p>In my most recent position, I was part of a multidisciplinary group
designing hardware for HPC and AI. My team specialized in the software
aspects of this project, and among other things, I contributed to the
development of a PGAS-like library that worked with C/C++, D, and
Python.</p>
<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> My research focuses on the exact optimization of
large-scale combinatorial problems using Branch-and-Bound (B&amp;B)
methods. These problems lie at the heart of many industrial and
decision-making processes, with direct applications in areas such as
logistics, production, scheduling, and network design.</p>
<p>B&amp;B algorithms rely on the implicit enumeration of the solution space
by exploring large, irregular, and dynamically generated search
trees. This often leads to the generation of massive amounts of data,
requiring substantial computational and memory
resources. Consequently, solving such problems efficiently calls for
the use of massively parallel systems.  However, modern supercomputers
are becoming increasingly large, diverse, and heterogeneous (e.g.,
CPU-GPU architectures), and are also more prone to faults—raising
numerous scientific challenges related to scalability, heterogeneity,
portability, fault tolerance, and software productivity.</p>
<p>While most of the existing literature adheres to the traditional MPI+X
model for parallel implementation, my research explores alternative
approaches based on different programming models, such as PGAS
(Partitioned Global Address Space). These models aim to unify the
multiple levels of parallelism (intra-node, inter-node, and GPU), to
provide a higher level of abstraction to the developer, and also to
favor portability.</p>
<p>This simplification, however, comes with its own set of challenges, as
practical limitations or performance differences may arise. My work
therefore investigates these trade-offs between performance and
software productivity, with the broader goal of contributing to the
discussion on future directions for exascale computing.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-does-chapel-help-you-with-these-problems">
<a href="#3-how-does-chapel-help-you-with-these-problems">3. How does Chapel help you with these problems?</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Tiago:</strong> In exact optimization, the historical focus has almost
always been on maximizing performance, often at the expense of
developer productivity. Traditionally, parallelizing these problems
means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Designing complex, often problem-specific, scalable data structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relying heavily on low-level languages like C/C++ for their
fine-grained control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For parallelism within a single node, you’re mixing threading
libraries like OpenMP or Pthreads with CUDA or other GPU libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For distributed programming, you’re typically using MPI to handle
the complex load balancing scheme, which is usually a challenging
and very long part of the code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This traditional approach requires a significant amount of effort
dedicated to managing the low-level complexities of parallelism and
load balancing/distribution.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">

Chapel truly stands out because it effectively unifies the different
parallel levels of modern GPU-powered clusters, handling everything
from inter-node communication to intra-node parallelism across both
CPUs and GPUs.
</p>
</div>
<div class="quote-container"><span class="close-quote">”</span></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A primary benefit in my research comes from features like the
<code>DistributedIters</code> module. These modules abstract away and manage many
of the traditionally complex components that we’d have to code
manually, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subproblems pool management</li>
<li>The load balancing scheme for the search</li>
<li>Termination criteria</li>
<li>And the reduction of results across different processes</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, Chapel truly stands out because it effectively unifies the
different parallel levels of modern GPU-powered clusters, handling
everything from inter-node communication to intra-node parallelism
across both CPUs and GPUs—with GPU portability. This significantly
frees us from implementing the most complex and error-prone aspects of
a distributed combinatorial search, allowing us to focus more on the
optimization problem itself, rather than the intricate details of
inter-process communication.</p>
<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> I agree with what Tiago said, but want to add my
personal experience as well. From my side, I would say that the main
Chapel features that have supported my work are the high-level
unification of various levels of parallelism (intra-node, inter-node,
and GPU), its portability, as well as the vendor-neutral design of its
GPU support. Other aspects—though not specific to the language
itself—include its object-oriented design and its interoperability
with other languages such as C. Its high-level nature and Python-like
syntax also make Chapel particularly quick and enjoyable to learn and
use.</p>
<h4 id="4-what-initially-drew-you-to-chapel">
<a href="#4-what-initially-drew-you-to-chapel">4. What initially drew you to Chapel?</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Tiago:</strong> Back in 2018, my supervisor, Professor Melab, gave me a
task: to research programming languages for the ‘Exascale-era’ and
identify candidates for parallel and distributed combinatorial
search. We didn’t have the exact terminology then, but the goal was to
explore languages from projects like HPCS and figure out how they
could benefit exact optimization.</p>
<p>After looking into several options, UPC and Chapel were the top
ones. But it was Chapel’s distributed iterators built on top of PGAS
that really caught my eye—they seemed to perfectly fit our specific
needs. Chapel also stood out as the only language with a truly active
community and direct support from its development team.</p>

<p>Initially, after I presented Chapel’s features to the group, some
members were a bit skeptical. However, after I implemented some proofs
of concept, I was able to demonstrate Chapel’s potential: I got a
single-node Chapel version as fast as C+OpenMP, and developed a first
distributed application that was competitive with MPI+OpenMP in terms
of performance, but with significantly fewer lines of code.</p>
<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> I started working with Chapel at the beginning of my
Ph.D. in 2021 when I joined the research project initiated by Tiago
Carneiro and Nouredine Melab. The opportunity to work with a promising
high-level PGAS-based language designed specifically for exascale
computing—offering an alternative to traditional MPI+X
approaches—immediately appealed to me.</p>
<h4 id="5-what-are-your-biggest-successes-that-chapel-has-helped-achieve">
<a href="#5-what-are-your-biggest-successes-that-chapel-has-helped-achieve">5. What are your biggest successes that Chapel has helped achieve?</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Tiago:</strong> Here are the key achievements that come to mind:</p>
<p>First, we achieved unified parallel programming across an entire
large-scale GPU cluster. This means we can program all levels of
parallelism—CPU cores, GPUs, and inter-node communication—all with a
single language. This dramatically simplifies development by letting
us avoid the complex mix of different programming languages and
libraries typically needed for each parallel level. For instance, we
no longer had to manually program intricate MPI-based load balancing
schemes (see the figure below as well as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X1930946X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this
paper</a>). This
significantly higher productivity in combinatorial search was achieved
with minor parallel performance losses.</p>
<p>Another success came with Chapel’s native GPU support. Before its
official support, our code was quite complex and difficult to maintain
because we had to mix Chapel with CUDA C via an interoperability
layer. That meant maintaining separate kernel versions for each GPU
library, plus their C wrappers, and the Chapel calls. By switching to
Chapel’s native GPU capabilities, we achieved a significant
improvement: our distributed application code became 65% shorter,
making it much cleaner and easier to manage.</p>
<p>Finally, we demonstrated that it’s possible to achieve both code
portability and performance portability in distributed combinatorial
search using Chapel’s native GPU support. We compared our Chapel-only
distributed GPU search vs. its hybrid counterparts that mixed Chapel
with CUDA (for NVIDIA) and HIP (for AMD). The Chapel-only version
consistently achieved similar parallel performance to its hybrid
rivals and showed similar strong scaling on up to 1024 GPUs, which
really validated its capability across diverse hardware vendors (see
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-69583-4_27" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this
paper</a>
for details).</p>
<p>To give an idea of how the project has evolved, in 2020 we were using
a few dozen GPUs, mixing CUDA+Chapel, and solving smaller instances—up
to Queens21. Today, with a Chapel-only code, we can solve an instance
around 80x bigger (e.g., Queens23) in less than an hour using more than
1000 GPUs.</p>

<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> As Tiago pointed out, one of the major achievements of
our research is the successful implementation of massively parallel
and heterogeneous B&amp;B algorithms using a single programming
language. This stands in sharp contrast to the C+MPI+OpenMP+CUDA
approaches commonly found in the literature, which typically involve a
significantly higher cost in terms of learning curve, implementation
effort, debugging complexity, and long-term maintenance.</p>
<p>Another particularly satisfying outcome is the successful deployment
of our Chapel-based codes across a wide range of platforms—from a
simple laptop to (pre-)exascale supercomputers featured in the TOP500
list (e.g., Frontier and LUMI)—including both NVIDIA and AMD GPU
architectures. Remarkably, this has been achieved with minimal effort
dedicated to portability.  We have already scaled our applications to
more than 51,200 CPU cores and 1,024 GPU accelerators, leading to many
outcomes in terms of solving hard problem instances, validating our
approach at scale, and demonstrating the viability of PGAS-based
designs on state-of-the-art heterogeneous platforms. For example, we
confirmed the optimality of some very hard flowshop scheduling problem
instances in under two hours using CPUs only, which required the
exploration of approximately <small><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>95</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>15</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">95×10^{15}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7278em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord">95</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">0</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">15</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></small> tree
nodes. This is particularly notable, as such a result would have been
inconceivable just a few years ago without relying on hundreds of GPU
accelerators.</p>
<h4 id="6-if-you-could-improve-chapel-with-a-finger-snap-what-would-you-do">
<a href="#6-if-you-could-improve-chapel-with-a-finger-snap-what-would-you-do">6. If you could improve Chapel with a finger snap, what would you do?</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Tiago:</strong> This question immediately brings to mind a very specific
situation I often face in my work with irregular applications and
benchmarking.</p>
<p>If I could improve one thing with a finger snap, it would be to
enhance Chapel’s iterators by allowing for runtime selection of
iterator types via an environment variable.</p>
<p>I constantly need to test different combinations of Static, Dynamic,
and Guided iterators to find the optimal load balancing strategy. This
means my code gets quite repetitive, with separate segments for each
type. If, similar to OpenMP’s <code>OMP_SCHEDULE "guided,4"</code>, I could just
set an environment variable to switch between these strategies at
runtime, my code would be significantly shorter and my development
process much more efficient.</p>
<p>Beyond that, something I’ve personally been wishing for since 2018 is
a distributed work-stealing iterator. Honestly, maybe that’s even
something I could have tried to program myself.  =)</p>
<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> One point that often comes up in this interview
series—and that I personally agree with—is that Chapel’s compilation
times are noticeably slower than those of its counterparts, such as C
or C++. However, I’m aware that the development team has already made
significant efforts to improve this and continues to work actively on
it, and I’m grateful for their ongoing commitment.</p>
<h4 id="7-anything-else-youd-like-people-to-know">
<a href="#7-anything-else-youd-like-people-to-know">7. Anything else you’d like people to know?</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Tiago:</strong> I believe a key reason for the ChOp research’s success was
the strong support the Chapel team provides to its users.</p>
<p>In 2018, it was technically difficult to use the language on the
infrastructure I had access to, and some features we needed were
sometimes experimental or not officially supported. Without this close
support, our research might have taken a different path or faced
significant delays.</p>
<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> I completely agree with that, and I would even add that
the many efforts dedicated to the Chapel ecosystem (such as
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/chapelcon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChapelCon</a>, formerly CHIUW)
are highly beneficial to the users. A concluding message for readers
would be “Try Chapel yourself!”.</p>
