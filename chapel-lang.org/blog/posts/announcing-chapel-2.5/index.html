<a href="#distributed-sorting">Distributed Sorting</a>
</h3>
<p>Chapel 2.5 includes a new implementation of scalable distributed
sorting.  This implementation supports comparison- and radix-sorting
of Block-distributed arrays, and it can be called from the standard
library <code>sort()</code> procedure. When sorting random integers on 128
nodes of HPE Cray EX, the new implementation is ~5x faster than the
previous (undocumented) distributed radix sort in the standard
library, and ~2x faster than the radix sort used in
<a href="https://arkouda-www.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkouda</a> to implement its GroupBy
operations.</p>
<figure class="fullwide"><img alt="A performance comparison between the new sort implementation, Arkouda’s custom sort, and the previous (undocumented) distributed sort." src="../../posts/announcing-chapel-2.5/sort.jpg"/><figcaption>

<p>To make use of this new sort implementation, simply pass a
Block-distributed array to Chapel’s standard
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/modules/standard/Sort.html#Sort.sort" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><code>sort()</code></a> procedure.</p>
<h3 id="chapel-editions">
<a href="#chapel-editions">Chapel Editions</a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="../../posts/announcing-chapel-2.0/">Chapel 2.0 release</a>
represented a promise that we wouldn’t make breaking changes to the
language willy-nilly.  But there are still breaking changes we will
need to make, both to improve upon existing features, and to address
future requests from users.  With that in mind, Chapel 2.5 includes
a new <em>editions</em> feature that takes its inspiration from Rust.</p>
<p>Chapel’s editions provide a known stable version of the language via
the default 2.0 edition.  They also provide a place for trying out
proposed changes via a new <span class="sidenote"><label class="sidenote-label" for="sidenote-1"><em>pre-edition</em></label><input class="sidenote-checkbox" id="sidenote-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote-content sidenote-right"><span class="sidenote-delimiter">[note:</span>Note that
in the 2.6 release this edition will be named “preview” instead.  This was a
name that occurred to us after the release or it would have been the name for
2.5.  Sorry for the churn!<span class="sidenote-delimiter">]</span></span></span>.  Users will get the 2.0
edition by default; or they can explicitly request it by compiling
with the new edition flag, using<br/> <code>--edition=2.0</code>.  Meanwhile, users
who want to experiment with anticipated breaking changes can compile
with <code>--edition=pre-edition</code>, though we do not recommend
distributing production code with this setting.</p>
<p>As of Chapel 2.5, the pre-edition only contains a revision to the
<code>reshape()</code> procedure, as described in the next section.  Going
forward, we intend to add other breaking changes to the pre-edition
as they come up.  Once we have accumulated enough changes—and have
enough experience with them—we will make a new official edition that
bundles those changes.  Please continue to make suggestions on how
to improve the language via <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github
issues</a> or one of our
various <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/community/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">communication
platforms</a>.</p>

<a href="#aliasing-array-reshaping">Aliasing Array Reshaping</a>
</h3>
<p>Though Chapel has long supported the ability to reshape an array
from one rank and/or shape to another, this has always been done by
copying the array’s elements.  Thus, if a user were to write:</p>

elements, since <code>B2D</code> would have its own copies of them.</p>
<p>Users have long requested the ability to have a reshape procedure
that results in an alias to the original array’s elements rather
than a copy.  In Chapel 2.5, we have added support for this feature,
making it part of the pre-edition mentioned above, due to it being a
breaking change relative to Chapel 2.0.</p>
<p>In order to get an aliasing reshape, it is crucial that the result
of the reshape be captured in a <code>ref</code> declaration or passed to a
<code>ref</code> argument.  For example, rewriting the previous example as
follows and compiling with <code>--edition=pre-edition</code> demonstrates that
the original array <code>A</code> has been modified through the assignment to
<code>A2D</code>:</p>

</div><p>Note that, at present, alias-based reshaping is only supported for
local arrays since it isn’t obvious that aliasing reshapes make
sense for distributed array types.  To reshape a distributed array,
an optional <code>copy=true</code> argument can be provided to opt back in to
the copy-based behavior that Chapel has traditionally provided.</p>
<p>This new version of <code>reshape()</code> also has some quality-of-life
improvements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>permitting the new shape to be specified as a list of ranges
(e.g., <code>reshape(A, 1..2, 1..2)</code>),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inferring the upper bound when reshaping to a 1D array (e.g.,
<code>reshape(A, 1..)</code>), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flagging likely mistakes when dimensions are fragmented or
combined in surprising ways.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For details, refer to the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/language/spec/arrays.html#ChapelArray.reshape" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online
documentation</a>
for <code>reshape()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="improved-debugging">
<a href="#improved-debugging">Improved Debugging</a>
</h3>
<p>Chapel 2.5 includes significant improvements to debugging support,
making it easier to identify and resolve issues in your code.
Historically, Chapel has had limited debugging capabilities, which
has been a barrier for many users, especially those accustomed to
more robust debugging tools in other languages.</p>
<p>This release addresses some of these challenges by expanding the
Chapel VS Code extension to better support shared-memory
debugging. This makes it much easier to visually debug Chapel
programs.</p>
<figure class="fullwide"><img alt="A screenshot of debugging Chapel from within VS Code" src="../../posts/announcing-chapel-2.5/debug.png"/><figcaption>
<p>A screenshot of debugging Chapel from within VS Code</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The limited debugging support that Chapel has traditionally had has
been geared toward the compiler’s C back end. This usually meant
debugging Chapel code in terms of C code and C variables, which is
cumbersome.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, Chapel variables and structures would be directly
accessible in a debugger without any use or knowledge of C. This
release moves Chapel towards this vision by having the compiler
generate better debug information when using the default LLVM back
end. Although further improvements are still needed, Chapel 2.5
represents a tangible improvement on the road to a more seamless
debugging experience in Chapel.</p>
<p>To learn more about these improvements, see the new <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/usingchapel/editor-support.html#debugging-in-vscode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Debugging in VS
Code</a>
section in the editor documentation.</p>
<h3 id="improvements-to-the-dyno-compiler-front-end">
<a href="#improvements-to-the-dyno-compiler-front-end">Improvements to the Dyno Compiler Front End</a>

<p>As you may have seen in <a href="../../posts/announcing-chapel-2.4/#dyno-support-for-chapel-features">previous</a>
<a href="../../posts/announcing-chapel-2.3/#dyno-compiler-improvements">release</a>
<a href="../../posts/announcing-chapel-1.31/#scope-resolution-and-errors-by-dyno">announcements</a>, <em>Dyno</em>
is the name of a project whose aim is to modernize and improve the
Chapel compiler. Dyno improves error messages, allows incremental
type resolution, and enables the <a href="../../posts/chapel-py/">development of language
tooling</a>.  Among the major wins for this
ongoing effort is the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.5/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chapel Language Server
(CLS)</a>,
which was previously featured in a <a href="../../posts/chapel-lsp/">blog post about editor
integration</a>.  Our team has been hard
at work implementing many features of Chapel’s type system in Dyno,
which—among other things—will enable tools like CLS to
provide more accurate and helpful information to users.</p>
<h4 id="more-language-features">
<a href="#more-language-features">More Language Features</a>

<p>This release has seen additional support for language features come online
with Dyno, where some notable examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>reduce=</code> expressions</li>
<li>array indexing and slicing</li>
<li>n-dimensional array literals</li>
<li>de-tupling loop indices</li>

<p>This release also includes experimental support for using Dyno to generate
executable code, which is a major step toward Dyno’s goal of replacing
the front end of the production compiler. This is an ongoing process that involves taking
the information that Dyno has about the program and generating AST for
the production compiler, essentially skipping over its
type resolution and analysis phases. This capability is enabled using the
<code>--dyno</code> command-line flag.</p>
<p>Initial support is limited to a subset of Chapel’s language
features, but will grow over time. Here is a simple example program
that Dyno can now compile, demonstrating the use of extern blocks
and the <code>c_ptr</code> type:</p>

<p>Dyno can also compile additional features into executables,
including enums, select-statements, and others.  Stay tuned as we
continue to add support for more features!</p>

</h4>
<p>In addition to improving Dyno’s resolver and converter, a lot
of effort has been dedicated in this release to Dyno’s performance.
Using algorithmic improvements, better data structures, and strategic
caching, the team was able to reduce the time it takes Dyno to
resolve programs by as much as 5x in some cases. Though Dyno has not
yet achieved full support for all Chapel features, our recent
experiments put it ahead of the production compiler in terms of
resolution speed:</p>

<p>Since Dyno powers the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chapel Language Server (CLS)</a>,
these performance improvements will be reflected in the form of faster diagnostics and type-based
hints in any editor that uses the Language Server Protocol – including
VS Code. Coincidentally, since Dyno’s stability has improved since the
initial release of resolver-based LSP features, in Chapel 2.5 we’ve enabled
resolution-based diagnostics in CLS. Not only will you have more information
in your editor, but you’ll also have it faster than before.</p>
