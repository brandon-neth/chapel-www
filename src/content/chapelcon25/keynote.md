## Keynote: Christopher Rackauckas
### The Software Engineering of Julia's Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)
Scientific machine learning, denoted SciML, is the integration of machine learning into scientific computing. While it has become an academic discipline in its own right, one of the key drivers to the adoption of SciML has been the ongoing creation of readily-available software. In this talk I will introduce the key tenannts of SciML with a focus towards the implications for HPC software development. Showcases of methods such as universal differential equations and their successes for generating more accurate physical models from data will be intertwined with stories about the software architecture which has enabled the sustainable development of the Open Source SciML software ecosystem. The audience should leave with a deep understanding of how the trade-off between research software and reusable open source development can be managed in a way that is beneficial to both the research community and the broader scientific computing community.
