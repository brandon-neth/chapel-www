## Sessions
### About Tutorial Days
The first two days of ChapelCon '25 (October 7 and October 8) will focus on action. Each day will begin with a guided tutorial, followed by hands-on exercises in the group, followed by free coding sessions, where participants can work on their own applications or on provided project prompts. 
#### Tutorials
Tutorial days will begin with in-depth tutorials covering a range of topics: building/installing Chapel, traditional programming language features (basic usage, classes/records, IO, standard modules), and HPC-focused topics (locality, parallelism, distributed data, synchronization). No prior knowledge or preparation needed.
#### Free Coding Sessions
Work on projects with other Chapel enthusiasts in the Free Coding session. We'll begin with guided exercises to warm up then shift to less structured work on personal projects or provided prompts. The Free Coding Sessions will be a relaxed working environment, with Chapel developers present to answer questions, and breakout rooms for short demo sessions focused on solving specific, common problems.
#### Office Hours
Book an Office Hour for an in-depth peer-programming session with a [Chapel contributor](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) The team is here to help with just about anything–understanding features, resolving bugs, or diagnosing/resolving performance issues. To sign up for a session, fill out a short survey to help us understand your problem and best match you with a Chapel developer.

### About Conference Days
The two conference days will feature a mix of talks and demos from the community, a State of the Project update, a Keynote address, and Community Discussions. 
#### Talks
If you have research or applications involving Chapel, we want to hear about it! This track is an opportunity to showcase any study ranging from preliminary to already published work and get feedback from the Chapel community. Talk slots can run from 5 to 30 minutes. 
#### Demos
If you have code or visualization from Chapel-based work, this track is for you. You can demonstrate key parts of your implementation, show how it runs live, or advertise a new module or application you are working on. Demo slots can run from 5 to 30 minutes.
#### Posters and Extended Abstracts
ChapelCon '25 will accept submissions of posters and extended abstracts, with or without accompanying presentations. These contributions will be reviewed by the program committee and accepted work will be shared with attendees as part of the conference. These tracks are ideal for folks who are interested in sharing their work with the Chapel community but are unable to present on the day.
#### Community Discussions
As in previous years, conference days will include informal discussion periods to draw connections between different work presented each day.
