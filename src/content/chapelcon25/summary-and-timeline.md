ChapelCon '25 welcomes anyone with computing challenges that demand performance, particularly through parallelism and scalability. ChapelCon '25 brings together Chapel users, enthusiasts, researchers, and developers to exchange ideas, present their work, and forge new collaborations. Anyone interested in parallel programming, programming languages, or high performance computing is encouraged to attend. A wide range of sessions support all levels of experience, with Tutorials and Free Coding sessions for those looking to hone their skills, Office Hour sessions for those looking for help from Chapel developers, and Conference sessions for those looking to share and discuss their work. **ChapelCon '25 is free to attend and will be held virtually.**
