### LUMI: The Supercomputer of the North
#### Emanuele Vitali, CSC; Jorik van Kemenade, SURF
In this talk we will introduce LUMI, starting with a view on the consortium and how you can request resources, then focusing on its hardware (in detail, the LUMI-C and LUMI-G node architectures, and the network architecture). Then we will introduce the LUMI user support team, its way of working and its duties.

Finally, we will provide a short demo on how to install and run a simple Chapel program

### Spack: The Community’s Road to the HPSF and Version 1.0
#### Todd Gamblin, LLNL & HPSF, Invited Talk
The past year has been transformative for the twelve-year-old Spack project, starting with its inclusion in the High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF) and culminating in its 1.0 release. Spack v1.0, released in July, is the first version to offer a stable package API and to integrate true compiler dependencies into its core model—features developed over many years. This talk will cover how the Spack community evolved to this point and detail the decision-making process behind joining the HPSF and finally taking the plunge and going 1.0.
